<h2> About </h2>
<p>
The purpose behind this application is for my personal DnD games.  I would like to use this page to track some amount of character progression, and mostly keep a good list of everyone's characters across various games/groups.  You can see their race, class, level, allignment, and any character art they may have, as well as their name obviously.
